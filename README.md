# Smart Urban Energy

This repository contains our Semester 1 Project 4: **Smart Urban Energy**.

**Feature-branch workflow**, where all new features are developed in separate branches and merged into `development` through Pull Requests. The `master` branch represents the final, production-ready version and is protected from direct pushes.
